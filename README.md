# magentoCustomShipping

A magento custom shipping module made for Bas Trucks to calculate shipping prices of the magento tyres store with an external api

Currently not fully finished! <br>
This is just an example of how it is going to work out later

For this to work you have to enter the shipping url in the backend of the webshop. <br>
Depending on where the shipping calculator is running. ex. 'http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8000/api/prices/get'
